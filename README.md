# deep_learning_neural_networks_for_image_classification_-CNN-_and_biometrics_-GRU-

This projects involves deep learning and the variety of neural networks created that can learn from datasets including images and csv data files.

Object Detection CNN involves a convolutional neural network, which is most often used for classifying images as in this case. It is used to classify images from a dataset which includes cooking images, including vegetables, the different forms that they would be in (peeled, chopped, diced) and this involved much preliminary data annotation. This neural network had a lot of architectural experimentation including with inception and residual units. Involves Tensorflow and Keras technologies as well as matplotlib for plotting training/test accuracy over epochs to see if overfitting is occurring.

Biometrics GRU takes in biometric data given in the form of CSV files. By utilizing the data, a neural network was created involves GRU units for time-series data. It involves the utilization of the sklearn library as well as Tensorflow in order to create the neural network structure. A variety of different parameters and tuning was done as can be seen in the commented out code which represents different tuning of the parameters in order to reach higher and higher accuracy.
